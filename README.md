Problem
The environmental problems facing Sri Lanka are serious. Over the previous five years, there has been a 30% increase in respiratory ailments due to air pollution from traffic and industry, which has resulted in a large spike in particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide. Rivers and lakes have been contaminated by industrial waste and agricultural runoff, while soil contamination from pesticides and chemicals is having an effect on groundwater and agriculture. Stress and hearing loss are brought on by noise pollution from traffic and urbanization, whilst animals are disturbed and the night sky is obscured by light pollution from excessive artificial lighting.

These issues are caused by lax waste management, fast industrial growth, and a lack of stringent emission restrictions. Sri Lanka has to solve these by enforcing laws governing noise control, lowering vehicle emissions, improving waste disposal, and promoting energy-efficient lighting to lessen light pollution.

Assessing Solutions: Utilizing this World Voice system, search for solutions with an emphasis on doable recommendations, legislative modifications, Green Live Tips, and neighborhood projects. The type of pollutants can determine different solutions.
