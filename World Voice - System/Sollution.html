        <h2>Air Pollution Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean Energy: To cut emissions from fossil fuels, switch to renewable energy sources including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.</li>
            <li>Emission Controls: Put laws into place and uphold them to restrict emissions from motor vehicles and industrial sources, like scrubbers and catalytic converters.</li>
            <li>Public Transportation: To cut down on vehicle emissions, promote carpooling, walking, biking, and public transportation.</li>
            <li>Energy Efficiency: To cut down on energy use and emissions, encourage the use of energy-efficient buildings and appliances.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
        <h2>Water Pollution Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wastewater Treatment: Before releasing industrial and municipal wastewater into water bodies, be sure it has been properly treated.</li>
            <li>agriculture Practices: Use buffer zones and precision farming, among other sustainable agriculture techniques, to lessen the amount of fertiliser and pesticide runoff.</li>
            <li>Plastic Reduction: To stop plastic pollution in water bodies, use less single-use plastics and encourage recycling.</li>
            <li>Oil Spill Prevention: To stop spills, put safety precautions in place for drilling and oil transportation.</li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
        <h2>Soil Pollution Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainable Agriculture: To avoid contaminating the soil, use organic farming methods and less chemical fertilisers and pesticides.</li>
            <li>Hazardous garbage Management: Make sure you get rid of hazardous garbage properly and don't dump it illegally.</li>
            <li>Remediation: To stop additional soil pollution, clean up affected areas.</li>


        </ul>

    <div class="solution">
        <h2>Noise Pollution Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Zoning laws: Put zoning restrictions into place to keep residential and noisy industrial regions apart.</li>
                 <li>Use noise-canceling equipment and sound barriers to lessen the impact of noise.</li>
                <li>Raising Public Awareness: Inform people about the impacts of noise pollution and the mitigation strategies available.</li>


        </ul>
