              <h2>Air Pollution</h2>
              <p>caused by the release of hazardous materials into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, from cars, factories, power plants, and other sources.</p>

          <div class="pollution-description">
              <h2>Water Pollution</h2>
              <p>results of pollutants finding their way into lakes, rivers, and the ocean. Oil spills, untreated sewage, industrial waste, and agricultural runoff are common contributors.

          <img src="images/3.jpg" alt="Soil Pollution">
          <div class="pollution-description">
              <h2>Soil Pollution</h2>
              <p>This happens when the soil is contaminated by dangerous materials such as industrial chemicals, pesticides, and heavy metals. This may have an impact on biodiversity, groundwater quality, and plant development.

          <img src="images/4.jpg" alt="Noise Pollution">
          <div class="pollution-description">
              <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
              <p>involves excessive or annoying noise from industrial processes, construction, or transportation. It may cause stress, hearing loss, and disruption of wildlife.

      <div class="pollution-type">
          <img src="images/5.jpg" alt="Light Pollution">
          <div class="pollution-description">
              <h2>Light Pollution</h2>
              <p>results from artificial light that is either excessive or misdirected, which affects ecosystems, messes with wildlife behaviour, and makes the night sky less visible.
